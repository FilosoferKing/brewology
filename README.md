# Brewology

Brewology's aim is to become the defacto site for all things craft beer. At this point the competition in the space is limited to two main sites: Ratebeer.com and Beeradvocate.com. Neither site has shown any improvement or change in many years. Brewology is looking to implement modern web technologies in the space and attract users with a better user experience as well as new tools that have not been introduced to the craft beer community. The outlook and versions for Brewology are as follows:

### Version 0.5

Version 0.5 will have the following features:

1. google map api search: User will be able to search for breweries by name, zipcode or city and state
2. database return: The user input will query the proprietary database and return a list of the closest breweries to them
3. brewery display on dashboard: The breweries will be displayed in a section below in a panel format as well as on the map itself with a marker
4. User login: Users will have the ability to login which can be enabled either by signing onto the site as well as facebook. Signing in will unlock certain features
5. Breweries individual page: Each brewery will have a page that will act as their "homepage" for the site. It will contain a variety of information that will be initiated in later versions of the site.

### Version 1.0

1. Favorite Breweries: Users will be able to save their favorite breweries to their profile. When they log in, this list will be displayed
2. Fave Breweries Newfeed: The breweries in the list give the user access to the latest news from those breweries as gathered from users or the breweries themselves.
3. Special Release Info: This was the inital crux of the site. The special release information for each fave brewery will be a main part of the newsfeed for the user. Also, whenever a brewery is viewed, the special release info will be displayed on the top.
4.Special Release Data: This will contain the brewery name, release date, name of beer, date of release, how to obtain the release, and a link to the release page. (This will initially be user/moderator/admin created, but hopefully will be updated by the breweries in the future).
5. Special Moderator Status: There will be special designated users that will have the ability to update information on the site by way of tools provided by the admin. This will help in easing the workload on the admin to try and keep up with the inital information. The info will initially be found on social media outlets such as facebook/instagram.

### Version 1.5

1. Brewery Portal: In the advanced version of the site the breweries will have a portal that they can log into that will give them the ability to update the information for their brewery using their tools. This could include updating their tap lists, special release information, or special events that they want to inform the user base of.
2. Portal Data: This is still in the R&D stage and will need to be thought out more before work on it can begin. Also, the hope will be that a user base will be built at this time so that breweries (especially new ones) will see the benefit in becoming part of brewology.
3. Monetization model: There will most likely be two major forms of monetization. Advertisement and brewery subscription. Both models are a work in progress at the moment.
